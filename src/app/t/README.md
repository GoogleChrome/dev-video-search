# Read transcripts from Google developer videos

This directory includes code for displaying readable transcripts of Google developer videos.

The transcripts have Google Translate built in, so you can choose read them in a different language. Caption highlighting is synchronised with video playback — and you can tap or click on any part of a transcript to navigate through the video.

**NB: the YouTube `getCurrentTime()` API seems not to function in the context of some Chrome extensions, so for caption highlighting, you may need to view transcripts in Incognito Mode.
